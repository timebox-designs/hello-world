                                    #VolunteersofSFU is a new dynamic social media campaign, inspired by the wildly
                                    popular Humans of New York Facebook Page, which is devoted to providing recognition
                                    and appreciation to the fantastic and dedicated volunteers of Simon Fraser
                                    University (SFU). Whether students are volunteering on or off campus, for a short
                                    period of time or a long period we want to recognize their contribution, and share
                                    their story with others.

                                    The official launch of this project was featured on Facebook, Social Media, and The
                                    Peak Newspaper, in several Volunteer Events, and through a guerrilla 'interruption'
                                    poster and sign campaign. All of this culminated in the launch event, which occurred
                                    May 17th and 18th on SFU Burnaby campus, and on SFU Surrey campus May 19th 2016.
