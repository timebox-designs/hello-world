                                Launch "Kindle's Book Club" on social media. Using "World's biggest book store" as its
                                slogan, it could have a picked-by section on its reading list, similar to a physical
                                bookstore. The list features a shared "Book of the Month", chosen by a well-known
                                author, blogger or literary critic. For a month, the book would be prominent in the
                                store and at the top of the Book Club reader list, with info about who recommended it.
                                At the end of the month, Kindle would curate an online book club discussion, using the
                                book's title as a hashtag.
